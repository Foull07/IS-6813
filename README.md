#  Swire Coca-Cola
## Project Overview
This project uses a data-driven approach to help Swire Coca-Cola optimize delivery services by identifying customers best suited for cost-effective White Truck logistics versus high-cost Red Truck services. By analyzing historical delivery data, we aimed to develop predictive models and clustering methods that support smarter customer segmentation and improve operational efficiency.

## Business Problem
Swire Coca-Cola's Western USA operations suffer from high logistical costs due to indiscriminate use of Red Truck services. The core challenge was to predict which customers should be whitelisted for White Truck service, enabling Swire to streamline costs while preserving customer value.

## Approach to solving the business problem (Group)
Our group combined supervised and unsupervised modeling approaches:
- Supervised: Models such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest were used to classify customer types based on volume and growth.
- Unsupervised: We clustered customers using order volume trends, delivery types, and state-level density to identify meaningful segments.
We proposed a volume-based thresholding system to determine onboarding/offboarding eligibility and presented Swire stakeholders with both cost-saving and revenue-retention opportunities.

## Business value generated by the solution (Group)
- Estimated Forfeited Opportunity (from suboptimal Red Truck assignments): ~$52M–$74M/year.
- Projected Cost Savings from offboarding low-volume customers: ~$7.6M/year.
- Revenue Retention from high-potential partners: $170.6M at 20% profit margin.
- Models helped simulate strategic onboarding/offboarding using thresholds and predictive scores.

## Contribution to the project
Running Random Forest classification in R to analyze partnership likelihood, especially among non-LMP customers.
Identifying that ~60% of misclassified non-partners shared similar traits to LMPs—indicating strong conversion potential.
Supporting dataset merging, feature engineering (e.g., gallons + cases aggregation), and cross-validating model results.
Creating key plots and feature importance visualizations to support final recommendations.

## Challenges
Data imbalance in partner vs. non-partner labels made modeling harder; addressed using balanced sampling.
Missing values in key customer features required imputation and validation.
Translating model outcomes into actionable business strategies required collaboration and iteration.

## Lessons Learned
This project sharpened my ability to link analytics with real business problems. I deepened my understanding of Random Forest modeling, gained practice in handling dirty and imbalanced datasets, and improved my skills in communicating model results to non-technical stakeholders.
